LUCK is a full-stack, decentralized web3 lottery with a twist.
Using the Chainlink VRFCoordinator for randomness. (because the blockchain is deterministic)

LUCK is made out of 3 parts:
1) LUCK has a token on the Ethereum blockchain, called LUCK token with the symbol LCK.
There are 1,000,000 LUCK tokens EXACTLY and their usage and therefore tokenomics rely on the Luck Bank.
2) LUCK Lottery, a website that players can buy tickets to bet on an array of elements to earn the ETH in the price pool, the price pool is the total ETH that was bet on each lottery by the players.
Each ticket cost 50$ in ETH value but can and will change later.
at the end of each lottery 10% of the price pool will go to the LUCK Bank and the other 90% is distributed to the winners of the lottery, if there are any, otherwise, the ETH will carry on to the next lottery price pool.
The lottery is different every time with a changing difficulty level and changing elements to bet on, so it will feel fresh every time.
3) LUCK Bank, the LUCK Bank is a smart contract that you can stake your LUCK tokens and get your share of ETH earned from the activity of the LUCK lottery, the LUCK Bank is accesible at the /stake page on the LUCK website.

*Note that for now everything is only deployed on the Sepolia testnet!!!*
